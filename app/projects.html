          <div class="details">Music Workshop is a fantastic project put forward by Prof. GangtieZheng in 2013 and started in the summer of 2013. It was first developed by several 3year undergraduate students majoring in Engineering in TEEP (Tsien’s Excellence in Education Program) at Tsinghua University. Music Workshop’s dream is to create and define the future music. Maybe you haven’t thought that thing before, but now we want to create a new band just played by machine automatically. Because of these machines, the system can play lots of difficult music which cannot be played by human beings. We believe it must be the new future of music we are imagining. Now we have 5 4-year undergraduate students working for the project. From 2013 to 2015, we have got 3 creative instruments for our band: xylophone, saxophone and harp. And we have already tried a concert consisting of saxophone, harp played by the machines and piano, violin played by humans. Also, in our web, you can also get many surprises about other interesting recitals. So if you want to know what future music will be, come to see our project. Music Workshop, imagine a creative future.</div>

          <div class="details">Automatically playing saxophone is another subproject ofthe Music Workshop project. We try to use a pneumatic and control system to let the saxophone play music automatically by itself. This project started in 2014 studied by 3students, Xin bao, ZeZhang, and XiaoqiangWang. They tried to use some methods to control the mouthpiece and keys of saxophone. However, because of the difficulty in controlling the reed and keys of the saxophone, they did not finish the work by the time they graduated. In the summer of 2014, I took over this project and did some research in controlling the reed of saxophone. And in the beginning of 2015, Wanyu Zhang participated in the program. By now, we have managed to let it work, which can play several simple music, such as Happy Birthday, Two Tigers, Little Star as you can see below.</div>

          <div class="details">From 2013 to 2014, several alumni in Tsinghua University finished the xylophone. That was the first achievement of Music Workshop. In 2014, because of the Open Research for Innovative Challenges (ORIC) proposed by Tsien’sExcellence in Education Program (TEEP), 5 students from TEEP interested in Music took part in this program and tried to create new systems for new instruments. From 2014 to 2015, we added saxophone and harp, which made us successfully create a basic machine band with harp, saxophone and xylophone. However, as we can see from these videos, these system can only PLAY MUSIC, but cannot PLAY MELODIES. Their sounds should be improve to make the music more melodious and fascinating.</div>
